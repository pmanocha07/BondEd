# BondEd

**Where Experience Meets Ambition**

## Overview
BondEd connects students with alumni mentors, exclusive opportunities, forums, and events.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Build CSS**: `npm run build:css`
3. **Serve locally**: `npm run start`

## Deployment
- Host `src/` on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify).
- Ensure `public/output.css` is generated if using the CSS build script.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
